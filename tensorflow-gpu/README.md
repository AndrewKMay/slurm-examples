# A Tensorflow/GPU Example

## Use:

 - Set up the environment using `make setup`.  This downloads the sample code from tensorflow.
 - Submit a job using `make run`.  The job ID will be output and you can use this to track progress
 - The job will write its standard out (STDOUT) to `out.txt`. If you ever want to re-run, use `make clean` to remove this output
